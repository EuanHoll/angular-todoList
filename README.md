# Angular-TodoList

A todo list website built using Angular.

## Little bit more info
This website uses [jsonplaceholder's todos]('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos') page as a backend for the todo example.<br>
Due to this you can't unfortunately edit the todos server side, but you can edit them client side, i.e it will work like normal, <br>
however when you refresh the page all your changes will have gone.
